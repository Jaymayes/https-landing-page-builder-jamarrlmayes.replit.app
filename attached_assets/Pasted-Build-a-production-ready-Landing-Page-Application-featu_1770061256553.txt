Build a production-ready Landing Page Application featuring a "Floating" AI Salesperson.

Goal
Create a high-performance Next.js landing page for an AI Venture Studio ("Referral Service LLC"). The core feature is a "Floating Digital Human" widget using the HeyGen Streaming Avatar SDK and OpenAI GPT-4o. The avatar must converse verbally, qualify leads, and suggest booking times.

Tech Stack
* Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS.
* AI Avatar: HeyGen Streaming Avatar SDK (via client-side WebRTC).
* Intelligence: OpenAI API (GPT-4o) for orchestration and conversation.
* State Management: React Context or Zustand for chat session state.
* Styling: Framer Motion for the "expand/collapse" widget animations.

Core Features (MVP)
1. The Landing Page Layout
   * Modern, clean B2B aesthetic.
   * Hero Section: Headline "The Convergence of Service and Software."
   * Services Section: Cards for "Business Upgrades" and "AI Company Creation."
   * Trust Signals: Placeholders for client logos and case studies.

2. The "Floating" Avatar Interface (Crucial)
   * Implement the "Floating Digital Human" pattern.
   * State A (Collapsed): A circular/pill-shaped widget in the bottom-right. Shows a small animated preview or static image with a status dot "Online - Ask me about AI".
   * State B (Expanded): On click, expand to a Side Panel (desktop) or Full Screen (mobile).
   * Visuals: The avatar video must use a transparent background (or match the UI background) to look like it is hovering.

3. Real-Time Conversation Logic
   * Initialize a HeyGen Streaming Session when the user activates the widget.
   * Capture user microphone input (browser MediaRecorder).
   * Send audio/text to OpenAI GPT-4o.
   * OpenAI System Prompt: "You are a senior AI consultant for Referral Service LLC. Your goal is to qualify the lead by asking about company size, pain points, and budget. Keep responses under 2 sentences. Do not promise specific deliverables without a consultation."
   * Stream the OpenAI text response back to HeyGen to generate lip-synced video.

4. Function Calling (The Execution Layer)
   * Enable OpenAI Tools/Function Calling.
   * Tool 1: `qualify_lead(name, company, email, pain_point)` -> Logs to console (mock HubSpot).
   * Tool 2: `check_availability()` -> Returns "I have slots Tuesday at 2 PM or 4 PM" (mock Calendly).
   * If the user expresses high intent, trigger `qualify_lead`.

5. "Interruptibility" UI
   * Add a visual "Listening" waveform when the user is speaking.
   * Add a "Stop/Interrupt" button that clears the current audio buffer if the user interrupts the avatar.

Files & Structure
* `app/page.tsx`: Main landing page content.
* `components/AvatarWidget.tsx`: The core logic for HeyGen connection.
* `lib/openai.ts`: Server action to handle the LLM request to protect API keys.
* `lib/heygen.ts`: Helper to generate the HeyGen session token.

Env Variables needed
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`
* `HEYGEN_API_KEY`

Deliverables
* Full code structure.
* Instructions on where to get the HeyGen Trial Token.
* A working "Start/End Session" flow for the avatar.

Implementation Note
Prioritize low latency. The avatar response loop must be as fast as possible. Ensure the background of the video element blends with the UI to avoid the "box" look.
